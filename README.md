<div align = "center">
  <h1>Rock Paper Scissors</h1>
  
  <h2> 👊✋✌️</h2>
  
  <p>
    Based on the previous project: 
    <a href = 'https://github.com/DeniseDichiara/Rock-Paper-Scissors---Draft'>
      Rock-Paper-Scissors---Draft
    </a>
  where the focus was on javastript
  </p>
  
 Starting from this, in the attuale project I added some CSS, to make everything nice and friendly for a better user experience.

 So the layout passed from this  
 <img src = 'https://github.com/DeniseDichiara/Rock-Paper-Scissors---Draft/blob/main/Draft%20Rock-Paper-Scissors.png'>
 <br>
 To this
 <br>
  <img src = 'https://github.com/DeniseDichiara/Rock-Paper-Scissors/blob/main/Rock%20Paper%20Scissors%20GitHub%20README.png'>
</div>
